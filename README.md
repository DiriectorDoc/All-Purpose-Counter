# All-Purpose-Counter
This is a very old project of mine. The very first commit is the entire project verbatim of what it was when I "finished" it.

## How it Works
Click or press a button. Number goes up. Yay. The more you click, the mroe it goes up. Click 10 times. Hooray, you just counted to 10.

Number is always fit to screen. Even when screen is resized.

Be sure to save your number somewhere. This project does not use cookies I'm pretty sure.
